                <p>Nwoke Maranma! Good looking, Cool and Collected! Happy Birthday to my darling husband at 50! I've shared
                    the last 18 years of it with you and it can only be summarized in one word 'BEAUTIFUL'. You said to me
                    before we got married 'I think we'll make a great team'. 18 years and counting, it's become reality.
                    We've laughed and cried together, seen the highs and the lows together and God being in between we're
                    a stronger team today and now a team of 6! The children adore you. My prayer for you always is that you
                    continue to reap the rewards and joy of your labour. You are our shinning Star! Bold and Courageous,
                    generous, kind, a true leader. Your latter days will be better than your former days in Jesus Name. Relax
                    and enjoy this new phase of life, your best years are still ahead ride on my darling I'm solidly behind
                    you. God bless! - Love from your wife </p>

                <p>On the day a man turned 50, he was asked to summarize his life experience so far. After deep reflection,
                    he had this to say 'like most people, I've labored, sacrificed and fought hard for the wealth I desired,
                    now I have wealth, I find myself laboring, sacrificing and fighting hard for happiness, joy and fulfillment.
                    O, how I wish I had invested my time in family which is where I realize now happiness and fulfillment
                    rests.' Okey, you a man that has always placed your family above everything else, above personal desires.
                    The good you have contributed to the world cannot be measured in words but in deeds for the love you
                    have bestowed unto your family shall be felt in different corners of the world as people interact with
                    your offsprings. Your blessings are abundant, your prayers answered, happiness, joy and fulfillment is
                    yours. May you have the most incredible 50th year as you celebrate every minute of your journey through

                <p>"Okey! My Brother! My friend! My co Inlaw! It is amazing how we hit off from the get go. It probably because
                    you are such a sweet person, and we are both from the same place. For me you are a family man. The bond
                    between you and your siblings is enviable. I am proud of you. I saw this poem on line and you exemplify
                    these qualities. OKE you are heaven sent from our father above, bonded by the power of love. No matter
                    What! you have our backs: when push comes to shove. <br> You are never demanding,all for one and one
                    for all, <br> Okey you make family the strongest team, the strongest unit; <br> if love could be visualized,
                    You make family the blue print. <br> forgiveness is sweetest fragrance, the power of family is a reflection
                    of God's compassion and magnificence. You lend a helping hand and not a finger pointing hand which is
                    really great and encouraging. <br> Happy 50th Birthday my brother. You are indeed a great person . Wish
                    you 50 more years in good spiritual and physical health</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>'Nwanne eji eje mba' doesn't do enough to capture what Okey means to me - unless you truly translate the
                    parts to English.  The first part means, 'Child of my mother' or what the Americans call 'brother from
                    another mother' - Okey has always been there for me and my family, with his wonderful words of encouragement
                    at key decision points, and his family is just an extension of mine.  The second part means 'reliable
                    warrior on life's journeys' - with Okey as a friend, your journey in life will be made joyful and fruitful,
                    because of his love and fierce loyalty.  Brother, as you turn 50, may your life's journey so far have
                    prepared you for the multitude of Blessings God is preparing to shower on you and your loved ones. Love
                    Always. </p>

                      <p> To An Exceptional Brother... 
Exceptional brothers are hard to find....
When God gives, He gives  on purpose, purposely
When He blesses, He blesses matchlessly
When He empowers, He does so exceptionally
When He sustains, He sustains 
So that His presence in our lives is unmistakably evident 
Such is the precious oldest brother whom we celebrate today as he turns the BIG Five O! 
Bros,
You are an exceptional gift from God
Thank God He chose you on purpose to purposely be my oldest brother
Blessed in matchless ways with wisdom unfathomable 
You are prodigiously different, in a class all by yourself
The miracle of life is not in what we have achieved, but in the fact that God sustained us until we achieved ...
This is why we know that the presence of God has been with you the past 50years!
Since God is the unchangeable Changer, 
We know beyond a shadow of doubt that He will yet keep and sustain you for yet another 50 years - this is just the beginning 
Get ready for an epi-phenomenal life ahead
Get ready for a greater Cause
In your first half you were a SUCCESS
but get ready cos you're about to become SIGNIFICANT 
May the light of God that illuminates flood your heart and pave your pathway 
May joy unspeakable and full of glory fill your heart 
May God keep you busy with the joy of your heart
May you be an answer to the ailing of our great Nation
May God preserve you for the special place He preserved for you in history
You have epitomized integrity, wisdom, commitment, focus, discipline, hard and smart work for the years I've known you
You have kept the faith and have taught your children the path of life
You are a light whose time has come to shine from the top of the hills
You are God's secret weapon, carefully and wonderfully created
You are God's mouthpiece to the people
You are OKECHUKWU ONUOHA !!
You are our brother and we are blessed to have you so.
We love you and appreciate you.Happy 50th birthday ! </p>

Okey is a trusted friend and a great inlaw and has always supported our family in all we have done.
We remain grateful to our Lord for preserving Okey' s life and giving him a wonderful but humble heritage, beautiful family, great career, numerous friends and well wishers and above all granting him the Grace to be a child  of the most High God.
We are particularly glad that the Lord has preserved his parent's life to witness this joyful celebration. He has blessed Okey with a wonderful wife and beautiful children.
We r glad and indeed very  proud to be a  part of Okey's family. He and his family  always receive  us with outstretched arms whenever we visit. We ask the Lord to preserve him in good health for us all and enlarge his coast as he serves the Lord in his faith and  through his works.
Congratulations dear Okey. Wè look forward to celebrating many more landmark  years  with you.  </p>
