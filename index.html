                  <p> Happy Birthday Dad. Thank you for paying for my school fees. I hope God gives you the ability to continue to pay now that you’re 50. You’re a’ real blessing to the family and pray God helps you in whatever situation your found in. I know you don’t like my behaviour most times but I’ll continue to work hard in all aspects of my life as a way to prove myself to you. God bless you and best wishes.
                  Much love,

                  <p> Happy Birthday Daddy I wish you many more to come and you will have so many more years that you will see your children’s children and still live even longer In Jesus Name. Amen. Thanks for always paying attention to my soccer career and for the many presents you always reward us with. Special thanks for the ps4 and for the fifa 17 as you see I have really enjoyed it.

                  <p> Nwoke Maranma!  Good looking, Cool and Collected! Happy Birthday to my darling husband at 50! I've shared the last 18 years of it with you and it can only be summarized in one word 'BEAUTIFUL'. You said to me before we got married 'I think we'll make a great team'. 18 years and counting, it's become reality. We've laughed and cried together, seen the highs and the lows together and God being in between we're a stronger team today and now a team of 6! The children adore you. My prayer for you always is that you continue to reap the rewards and joy of your labour. You are our shinning Star! Bold and Courageous, generous, kind, a true leader. Your latter days will be better than your former days in Jesus Name. Relax and enjoy this new phase of life, your best years are still ahead ride on my darling I'm solidly behind you. God bless! - Love from your wife, Chizoba Onuoha </p> <br> <br> <br>
                  <p> Happy 50th birthday to a dear big brother. As you enter into this new phase of your life we pray that your joy will know no bounds, you will experience God's goodness in a greater dimension and your light will shine even brighter. We pray that God will bless you more and every desire of your heart will be met.
                  God bless you abundantly. We love you very much. ----- Kingsley, Ify, Elroi and Ruach. </p> <br> <br> <br>

                  <p> "On the day a man turned 50, he was asked to summarize his life experience so far. After deep reflection, he had this to say 'like most people, I've labored, sacrificed and fought hard for the wealth I desired, now I have wealth, I find myself laboring, sacrificing and fighting hard for happiness, joy and fulfillment. O, how I wish I had invested my time in family which is where I realize now happiness and fulfillment rests.'
      Okey, you a man that has always placed your family above everything else, above personal desires. The good you have contributed to the world cannot be measured in words but in deeds for the love you have bestowed unto your family shall be felt in different corners of the world as people interact with your offsprings.
      Your blessings are abundant, your prayers answered, happiness, joy and fulfillment is yours. May you have the most incredible 50th year as you celebrate every minute of your journey through life.  Happy Birthday" ---- Kingsley Offor </p><br> <br> <br>
              <p>  "Okey! My Brother! My friend!  My co Inlaw! It is amazing how we hit off from the get go. It probably  because you are such a sweet person, and we are both from the same place.
                For me you are a family man. The bond between you and your siblings is enviable. I am proud of you. I saw this poem on line and you exemplify these  qualities.

               OKE you are heaven sent from our father above,
              bonded by the power of love. No matter What! you have our  backs: when push comes to shove. <br>

              You are never demanding,all for one and one for all, <br>

              Okey you make family the strongest team, the strongest unit; <br>
              if love could be visualized, You make family  the blue print. <br>

              forgiveness is sweetest fragrance, the power of family is a reflection of God's compassion and magnificence.
              You lend a helping hand and not a finger pointing hand which is really great and encouraging. <br>
              Happy 50th Birthday my brother. You are indeed  a great person . Wish you 50 more years in good spiritual and physical health "---- Chika Offor </p> <br> <br> <br>
              <p> 'Nwanne eji eje mba' doesn't do enough to capture what Okey means to me - unless you truly translate the parts to English. 
              The first part means, 'Child of my mother' or what the Americans call 'brother from another mother' - Okey has always been there for me and my family, with his wonderful words of encouragement at key decision points, and his family is just an extension of mine. 
              The second part means 'reliable warrior on life's journeys' - with Okey as a friend, your journey in life will be made joyful and fruitful, because of his love and fierce loyalty. 
              Brother, as you turn 50, may your life's journey so far have prepared you for the multitude of Blessings God is preparing to shower on you and your loved ones. Love Always, Chikezie Nwosu. </p> <br> <br> <br>
